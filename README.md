This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the things:

```bash
yarn
```

Fire up the app 
```bash
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


Build the app for deployment
```bash
yarn build
```

Run the linter
```bash 
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix 
```

Run tests
```bash
yarn test
yarn test:watch
yarn test:coverage
```


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
